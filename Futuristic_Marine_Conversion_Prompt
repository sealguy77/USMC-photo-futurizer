# Futuristic Marine Conversion

Transform this Marine image into a futuristic 22nd-century military operator. Preserve pose, proportions, and core identity.

## Armor & Equipment

**Powered Exoskeleton Options:**
- Tactical: Layered modular plating, visible hydraulics, weathered textures, scratches, dust
- Surveillance: Sleek form-fitting suit, integrated sensors, polished surfaces, angular design
- Combat: Light maneuverable plates, streamlined, battle-scarred, emphasizes speed and agility

**Helmet:**
- Enclosed with blue/blue-green internal display glow
- Integrated tactical visor (functional, not flashy)
- Command roles: Add holographic displays (cyan/electric blue) showing tactical data, maps, drone feeds
- Angular design balancing protection with mobility

**Weapons:**
- Modernized kinetic weapons with rail attachments, smart optics, ammo counters
- Realistic proportions
- Combat roles: Large caliber rifles, explosive ordnance, squad weapons
- Surveillance roles: Minimal visible weaponry
- Add pouches, utility attachments, tactical cables

**Vehicles & Aircraft**

**Ground Vehicles:**
- Angular, armored design with active camouflage panels
- Visible thruster/propulsion assists for enhanced mobility
- Integrated weapon systems (remote turrets, missile pods)
- Transparent armor sections with AR displays
- Modular cargo/troop compartments
- Weathered military finish with battle damage (tactical/combat roles)

**Aircraft:**
- VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) capability with tiltrotor or ducted fan design
- Stealth geometry with sharp angles and RAM (Radar Absorbent Material) coating
- Underwing hardpoints with smart munitions
- Cockpit with wraparound holographic displays
- Drone escort formation (optional)
- Blue/cyan engine glow and navigation lights
- Sleek, atmospheric entry capable design

**Color Schemes:**
- Tactical: Adaptive camouflage with digital patterns (desert tan, urban gray, woodland)
- Command: Dark metallic with blue accent lighting strips
- Combat: Battle-worn camo with unit-generic markings

## Technology

- Multi-layered transparent holographic screens (command roles)
- Data streams and AR overlay connections
- Small surveillance drones hovering nearby (optional)
- Neural interface indicators at temple/neck (optional)

## Colors

- **Tactical:** Muted earth tones (charcoal gray, desert tan, olive drab, urban gray)
- **Command:** Dark base (black/navy) + neon accents (cyan, electric blue, lime green)
- **Combat:** Modern angular camouflage (desert tan, woodland digital)
- No identifiable unit markings—generic futuristic Marine aesthetic

## Environment

- **Ground ops:** Dusty, foggy, or smokey. Overcast/dimly lit with internal suit lights
- **Command:** High-tech hub, sterile, glowing screens with blue/green dominance
- **Combat:** Ruined/hostile terrain, war-torn urban, dramatic shadows

## Rendering Style

Photorealistic CGI, film-quality:
- Weathered textures for field operations
- High detail on material wear and layered armor
- Cinematic lighting with practical shadows
- Command: Sleek aesthetic, glowing elements, translucent holograms
- Combat: Bold heroic rendering, dramatic contrast (high-noon sun/spotlights)
- Emphasize speed, durability, overwhelming force

## Preserve

1. Subject's pose, stance, body proportions
2. Facial structure (if visible) under helmet
3. Core composition and framing
4. Any motion or action
5. Lighting direction and time of day

## Technical Specs

- Time: 2150-2200 CE
- Tech: Grounded near-future (no energy shields, plasma weapons, anti-gravity)
- Resolution: Maintain or enhance
- Vehicles: Hybrid propulsion (jet/electric), advanced composites, realistic physics
